\textbf{Projects:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fall 2016: Led a three person team to build a fully autonomous robot in a Mechatronics course, completed the challenge second out of 25 teams. See \textbf{\texttt{\href{https://danielhunter.io/mechatronics/}{danielhunter.io/mechatronics}}} for video.
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Implemented a 3 level state machine in C to control the robot. Also wrote sensor interface modules to process data from analog to digital converters using software filtering methods such as hysteresis, debouncing, and synchronous sampling. 
%     \item Prototyped robotic subsystems to ensure effectiveness and efficiency of final design.
    \item Designed robot frame in Solidworks, manufactured using a laser cutter.
    \item Soldered custom circuits for infrared, tape, and magnetic field sensors, including active signal filters.
    \item Used management techniques and systems to ensure success, including Trello, GitHub, Gantt charts, and various spreadsheets.
